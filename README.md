# Driving API

## Prerequisites
* Docker

## Getting started
```
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:woutrbe/driving-api.git

# Change working directories
cd driving-api

# Start Docker
docker-compose up
```

After running `docker-compose up`, you should have 3 docker images running:
* driving-api
* mongodb
* rabbitmq

# Challenge

Build an API to calculate shortest driving path and estimated driving time to visit all specified locations, starting from the first in the list.  
Note that we expect shortest **driving** distance (and estimated travel time), so you may want to use [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)  

**Prefered languages** (you are **not** required to pick from them):
 - Node.js
 - PHP

**Solution requirements:**
 - Source code must be stored in git repository (you can send it as github or bitbucket link, dropbox/google drive public folder, etc. **NOTE: email servers will reject .zip files with source code**)
 - Blackbox. Must build/run in Docker container(s). `docker-compose.yml` must be provided
 - Must be asynchronous
 - Must be horizontally scalable
 - There is no specific requirements regarding documentation, architecture, etc. but **we expect your solution to be production ready**

**Task:**

Implement the following HTTP endpoints:

- [POST `/route`: Submit start point and drop-off locations](#submit-start-point-and-drop-off-locations)
- [GET `/route/<TOKEN>`: Get shortest driving route](#get-shortest-driving-route)

### Submit start point and drop-off locations

Method:  
 - `POST`

URL path:  
 - `/route`

Input body:  

```json
[
	["ROUTE_START_LATITUDE", "ROUTE_START_LONGITUDE"],
	["DROPOFF_LATITUDE_#1", "DROPOFF_LONGITUDE_#1"],
	...
]
```

Response body:  
 - `HTTP code 200`  

```json
{ "token": "TOKEN" }
```

or

```json
{ "error": "ERROR_DESCRIPTION" }
```

---

Input body example:

```json
[
	["22.372081", "114.107877"],
	["22.284419", "114.159510"],
	["22.326442", "114.167811"]
]
```

Response example:

```json
{ "token": "9d3503e0-7236-4e47-a62f-8b01b5646c16" }
```

### Get shortest driving route
Get shortest driving route for submitted locations (sequence of `[lat, lon]` values starting from start location resulting in shortest path)

Method:  
- `GET`

URL path:  
- `/route/<TOKEN>`

Response body:  
- HTTP 200  

```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"path": [
		["ROUTE_START_LATITUDE", "ROUTE_START_LONGITUDE"],
		["DROPOFF_LATITUDE_#1", "DROPOFF_LONGITUDE_#1"],
		...
	],
	"total_distance": DRIVING_DISTANCE_IN_METERS,
	"total_time": ESTIMATED_DRIVING_TIME_IN_SECONDS
}
```  
or  

```json
{
	"status": "in progress"
}
```  
or  

```json
{
	"status": "failure",
	"error": "ERROR_DESCRIPTION"
}
```

---

URL example:  
 - `/route/9d3503e0-7236-4e47-a62f-8b01b5646c16`

Response example:  
```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"path": [
		["22.372081", "114.107877"],
		["22.326442", "114.167811"],
		["22.284419", "114.159510"]
	],
	"total_distance": 20000,
	"total_time": 1800
}
```
